I spent my winter holidays at home with my family. This time in the holidays we didn’t go anywhere.
This time my winter holidays began on the 30th of December. This year it was so nice to have a little
rest from studies. I like New Year's holidays because at that time we celebrate a lot of holidays,
in particular New Year and Christmas. These are my favorite days. The first of these holidays is New Year’s Day.
So, in the first day of my winter break, in the evening I decorated our flat with lights
and dressed the New Year Tree with toys and spangle. I love the time when all the houses,
cafes and stores outside start hanging out New Year's decorations on their windows and doors.
It revives spirits and makes me really very happy. I like hearing "Jingle Bells"
and other New Year's songs from everywhere. It also sets the mystery specific
atmosphere of winter holidays. Sure I like the Christmas and New Year gifts that my dear parents buy
for me. But most of all I like the moment on the 31st of December when on TV the chime strikes 12
midnight and all members of my family gather together around the festive table with delicious dishes and drinks.
On the 7th of January my family and me celebrated Christmas. According to the old tradition there were twelve
dishes on the table. In black-letter day and when the weather is very bad I stayed at flat and watched TV.
During New Year's holidays there is always something interesting on. Sometimes my best friends came to me and we played computer games or listened to our favorite music together. But the holiday’s time passed so far. Certainly during winter holidays I have been reading interesting books and visiting useful webpages in Internet. I liked my last New Year’s holidays so much! I think I will not forget them forever.
